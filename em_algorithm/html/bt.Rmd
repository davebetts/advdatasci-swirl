## A little background on blood types

There are four blood types _A_, _B_, _O_, and _AB_. These are generated by a specific
gene that has alleles $A$, $B$, and $O$. The blood types match up to the genotypes like this:

* _A_ = $AA$ or $AO$
* _B_ = $BB$ or $BO$
* _AB_ = $AB$
* _O_ = $OO$

If $A$ has frequency $p$, $B$ has frequency $q$, and $O$ has frequency $r$ then if $Y$ is the vector of observed blood types, $Y$ has distribution

$Y \sim M_4(n,(p^2 + 2pr, q^2 + 2qr, 2pq, r^2))$
